creature would find it.

Just when the princess touched the relic, it
disappeared from Hyrule forever.


Since that day, Hyrule people lived in peace,

Thus the legend of Zelda, of the Triforce and

Hello Link, I am the chief of that village, I

Since this morning, monsters stride along

spell is blocking the access to the castle...
You say Ganon is responsible for all of that?
He stole the Triforce and he is holding
Princess Zelda captive?

Mmmm... The situation is more serious than I
thought...


We have to act very quickly, you must face
Ganon again!


How to enter the castle? I may have an idea...



As you know, the power of the 7 wise men was
locked in 7 crystals by wizard Aghanim when he
was trying to open up the path to the Dark
World, where Ganon was.
Yet, even if you raised the descendants of the
7 wise men from death after you defeated Ganon
and found the Triforce, these crystals have
kept their power.
They were hidden deep in the 7 temples, gather
them all, and you'll be able to get over
Ganon's spell.

However that won't be easy, Ganon will surely
send his best units to protect these
crystals...

One more thing, you won't go far with your
current equipment. Go and see the arms dealer
and tell him that you're coming on my behalf.
He will probably make a gesture for you.
